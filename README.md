# Machine Learning with AWS

This course offers a comprehensive introduction to Machine Learning (ML) concepts, paired with practical experience using AWS (Amazon Web Services) tools for ML deployment and scalability. The curriculum is divided into five key modules:

1. Introduction to Machine Learning Basics:
Gain foundational knowledge in ML concepts such as supervised and unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and key algorithms like regression, classification, and clustering. This module builds the essential groundwork for advanced ML topics.

2. Machine Learning with AWS:
Learn how to leverage AWS for ML tasks. This includes exploring AWS services like SageMaker, Lambda, and S3 for model training, deployment, and storage. By the end of this module, you’ll understand how to build, train, and deploy ML models on AWS at scale.

3. Software Engineering I:
Delve into the basics of software engineering principles, focusing on coding best practices, version control, and software development workflows. This module sets the foundation for writing efficient, maintainable code in real-world applications.

4. Software Engineering II:
Build upon the principles learned in Software Engineering I, exploring more advanced topics such as design patterns, testing methodologies, and debugging techniques. Gain hands-on experience in building robust, scalable software systems that can support ML workflows.

5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Understand the key principles of object-oriented programming, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. This module will help you design more modular and reusable code, crucial for developing scalable ML solutions.

## Objectives
By the end of this course, you’ll have a solid foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of ML, equipped to deploy and manage machine learning models on AWS, alongside strong software engineering skills to support scalable, maintainable ML solutions.
